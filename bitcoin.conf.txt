# Use the testnet3 chain. Equivalent to -chain=test. Support for testnet3 is deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming release. Consider moving to testnet4 now by using -testnet4.

# Use the testnet4 chain. Equivalent to -chain=testnet4.

# [relay]
# Relay and mine non-standard transactions (testnet/regtest only.)

# [network]
# If set, then this host is configured for CJDNS (connecting to fc00::/8 addresses would lead us to the CJDNS network)

# Always query for peer addresses via DNS lookup.

# Use NAT-PMP to map the listening port.

# Throw a non-fatal error at runtime if the documentation for an RPC is incorrect.
rpcdoccheck=1
# Sets default behavior for rpc whitelisting. Unless rpcwhitelistdefault is set to 0, if any -rpcwhitelist is set, the rpc server acts as if all rpc users are subject to empty-unless-otherwise-specified whitelists. If rpcwhitelistdefault is set to 1 and no -rpcwhitelist is set, rpc server acts as if all rpc users are subject to empty whitelists.
rpcwhitelistdefault=1

# [wallet]
# Group outputs by address, selecting all or none, instead of selecting on a per-output basis. Improves privacy at expense of higher transaction fees.

# Allow reusing wallet files across chains.

# [Sections]
# Most options automatically apply to mainnet, testnet, and regtest networks.
# If you want to confine an option to just one network, you should add it in the relevant section.
# EXCEPTIONS: The options addnode, connect, port, bind, rpcport, rpcbind and wallet
# only apply to mainnet unless they appear in the appropriate section below.

# Options only for mainnet
[main]

# Options only for testnet
[test]

# Options only for regtest
